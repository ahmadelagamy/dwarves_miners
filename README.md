# Dwarves

## Overview

This project implements a mining pool manager for a cryptocurrency network. It includes functionalities for distributing rewards to miners, handling miner registration, and processing work submissions. The system is designed to operate asynchronously to efficiently manage network interactions and reward distributions.

## Features

- **Reward Distribution**: Periodically distributes rewards to miners based on their performance.
- **Miner Registration**: Handles registration requests from miners, allowing them to join the mining pool.
- **Work Submission**: Processes work submissions from miners, which is essential for validating mining efforts and distributing rewards accordingly.
